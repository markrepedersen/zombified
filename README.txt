We implemented tool spawning and randomization. We also implemented the logic for our freezing tool.

We implemented the antidote random spawning and winning/losing condition with the antidote.

We fixed the toolbox implementation and added simple collisions between player and tools, and adding those items into the toolbox.

Arm and Leg limb collisions are also implemented.

Player is also able to use the tools using right shift and Q. This triggers slot on the toolbox to disappear.

Limb spawning and grouping logic is implemented.

Basic groundwork of pathfinding(Jump point search and A*) is done. Still has some bugs.

Complex geometry implemented.

Basic shader implementation to improve efficiency of animation.

Changed the proposal, attached with the code. Changes are due to unforeseen speed bumps.
